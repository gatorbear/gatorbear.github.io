                <p>If elected, these are some of the goals I will work towards to the best of my ability</p>
                <p><b>Accessibility</b>: Currently, it can be difficult for students not in the Student Government Association to see our information. Agendas and meeting minutes should be easily accessible. More students will know who their leaders are and that we are always available for them.</p>
                <p><b>Media</b>: I want to fund student media to keep students knowledgeable. SGA has a lot to benefit from students staying in the loop.</p>
                <p><b>Structure</b>: The executive branch is the only branch without a handbook. I want to change that. We have an office of standards in enforcement with no written regulation of what tasks they should do. The executive branch should head student news. I will work to create a cabinet from a wide range of Florida Poly Students. Hence, there are many different opinions on different issues.</p>
