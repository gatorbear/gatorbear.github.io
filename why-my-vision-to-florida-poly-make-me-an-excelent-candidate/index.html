Agendas and meeting minutes should be easily accessible. More students will know who their leaders are and that we are always available for them.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Media</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">: I want to fund student media to keep students knowledgeable. SGA has a lot to benefit from students staying in the loop.</span></p><p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Structure</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">: The executive branch is the only branch without a handbook. I want to change that. We have an office of standards in enforcement with no written regulation of what tasks they should do. The executive branch should head student news. I will work to create a cabinet from a wide range of Florida Poly Students. Hence, there are many different opinions on different issues.</span></p><footer><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgatorbear.github.io%2Fwhy-my-vision-to-florida-poly-make-me-an-excelent-candidate%2F" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://gatorbear.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgatorbear.github.io%2Fwhy-my-vision-to-florida-poly-make-me-an-excelent-candidate%2F&amp;via=connorcodd&amp;text=%20Why%20My%20Vision%20To%20Florida%20Poly%20Make%20Me%20an%20Excelent%20Candidate" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://gatorbear.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg></a></div></footer></div></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Paid for by Connor Coddington for SBP*</p><p>*Not actually paid because this was all free</p></div></footer></div></div><script defer="defer" src="https://gatorbear.github.io/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=5f48fc77cac90c4778fa24ec9c57f37d"></script><script defer="defer" src="https://gatorbear.github.io/assets/js/scripts.js?v=8d8da74413bdb3c2b8a987207ce19d2f"></script></body></html>
